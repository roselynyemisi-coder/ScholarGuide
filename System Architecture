# 🏗️ System Architecture – ScholarGuide Tech

ScholarGuide Tech is built as a scalable, cloud-based educational platform that connects students, mentors, parents, and institutions in one integrated ecosystem.  
The system is designed to ensure **security, flexibility, and real-time collaboration** across web and mobile platforms.

---

## 🧩 Overview

The system follows a **modular client–server architecture** with three core layers:
1. **Frontend (Client Layer)**
2. **Backend (Application Layer)**
3. **Database (Data Layer)**

These layers communicate seamlessly via **RESTful APIs** to deliver smooth user experiences across all devices.

---

## 🖥️ 1. Frontend (Client Layer)

The frontend is responsible for user interaction and presentation. It is designed to be responsive and consistent across web and mobile.

- **Frameworks:**  
  - Web: React.js  
  - Mobile: React Native  
- **Functions:**  
  - Displays dashboards, mentor profiles, and resources  
  - Handles real-time interactions during live mentorship sessions  
  - Integrates authentication and personalized user flows via API calls  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Role-based interfaces for students, parents, mentors, and admins  
  - Notifications and event reminders  
  - Optimized for accessibility and mobile responsiveness  

---

## ⚙️ 2. Backend (Application Layer)

The backend serves as the engine that powers all interactions and data management within the app.

- **Technology Stack:** Node.js with Express.js  
- **Functions:**  
  - Handles user authentication and authorization (JWT-based)  
  - Processes mentorship requests, bookings, and content uploads  
  - Manages API communication between frontend and database  
  - Controls access to educational resources and live session scheduling  
- **APIs:**  
  - RESTful APIs built for modular scalability  
  - Connected to third-party integrations such as LinkedIn, GitHub, and Google Meet for verification and live interactions  

---

## 🗄️ 3. Database (Data Layer)

ScholarGuide Tech uses a NoSQL database for flexibility and scalability.

- **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose ORM)  
- **Data Stored:**  
  - User profiles (students, mentors, parents, institutions)  
  - Mentorship sessions and chat logs  
  - Learning resources and media files  
  - Event schedules and performance analytics  
- **Security:**  
  - Encrypted data at rest  
  - Role-based access control to ensure user privacy  

---

## ☁️ 4. Cloud Infrastructure

- **Hosting & Deployment:** Render (for backend) and Firebase (for frontend + authentication)  
- **Media Storage:** Cloudinary for resource and image hosting  
- **Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment  

---

## 🔁 System Communication Flow

1. A user logs in or signs up via the web or mobile app.  
2. The frontend sends a request to the backend API for authentication.  
3. The backend verifies user credentials and retrieves data from MongoDB.  
4. The authenticated user is granted access to their dashboard.  
5. Any updates (e.g., mentorship booking, chat, or uploads) trigger real-time updates through API and Firebase notifications.  

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication for all API endpoints  
- Data encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS)  
- Admin-level monitoring via a secure dashboard  
- Periodic backup of user data on cloud storage  

---

## 🧱 Scalability & Future Expansion

The architecture is modular, making it easy to scale new features like:
- AI-powered mentorship matching  
- Learning analytics dashboard  
- Community forums  
- Integration with additional EdTech APIs  

---

## 🧭 Summary

The ScholarGuide Tech system architecture focuses on creating a **secure, scalable, and collaborative learning environment**.  
By combining React, Node.js, MongoDB, and cloud-based infrastructure, the platform ensures high performance and accessibility for users globally.
